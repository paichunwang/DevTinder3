# DevTinder3
 A professional social networking-platform that connects developers of all skill levels to challenging and rewarding projects, creating value for both the developer and customer. DevTinder v3 was created using the MERN (Mongodb, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. I chose to use this stack due to the initial iteration of DevTinder, which was created with Handlebars.js. Although handlebars is not a "bad" template engine,Â  it does not hold up to today's user standard of a quick and functional website. Furthermore, mongoDB was swapped in place of mySQL for the flexibility to expand horizontally when the application required.
